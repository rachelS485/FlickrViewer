 * @course: CSC 317; Spring 2022
 * @description: The purpose of this program is to be create an application
 * for browsing and viewing photos from flickr. This program will allow the
 * user to view and browse through actual photos that users of clicker have
 * posted, and that are publicly available. If a user wants more details about
 * an image, the user is able to click on the image, which would take the user
 * to a web page view of the actual post of the photo on the flickr site.
 * The functionality for browsing and viewing photos relies  on Flickrâ€™s
 * public API. This program uses a MainActivity which has 3 async tasks for
 * downloading the Json object and the 2 images. Then there is a WebViewActivity
 * that is used to display the website when the image is clicked. Then there
 * is a LoadNewImageService which is used to load new images in the background
 * every 10 seconds when the app is no longer active. This activity_web_view.xml
 * is responsible for displaying a flickr webpage when an image is clicked. This
 * xml does this by using a WebView which is an object that displays web
 * content as part of the activity layout, and embeds web pages in a
 * specially-designed environment for this app.
