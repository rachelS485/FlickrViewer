 * @assignment: Programming Assignment 6- Flickr Viewer
 * @course: CSC 317; Spring 2022
 * @description:The purpose of this program is to be create an application
 * for browsing and viewing photos from flickr. This program will allow the
 * user to view and browse through actual photos that users of clicker have
 * posted, and that are publicly available. If a user wants more details about
 * an image, the user is able to click on the image, which would take the user
 * to a web page view of the actual post of the photo on the flickr site.
 * The functionality for browsing and viewing photos relies  on Flickrâ€™s
 * public API. This program uses a MainActivity which has 3 async tasks for
 * downloading the Json object and the 2 images. Then there is a WebViewActivity
 * that is used to display the website when the image is clicked. Then there
 * is a LoadNewImageService which is used to load new images in the background
 * every 10 seconds when the app is no longer active. This LoadNewImageService.java
 * is responsible for being a background service that loads images in the background
 * extending an IntentService. This program does this by using the onHandleIntent()
 * to create a Bundle object that stores the necessary information like the image
 * Bitmaps, date take, file format, and tags to be passed into the message object.
 * This program sets the thread.sleep to 10000 so that the background images can
 * be changed after 10 seconds have passed.
